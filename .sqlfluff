[sqlfluff:indentation]
# Options for indentation rules (e.g., indent_unit = 2)
# You can specify preferred indentation for different clause types.

[sqlfluff:rules]
# You can enable/disable specific rules here
# For example:
# L003 = tab # Prefer tabs over spaces for indentation
# L001 = implicit # Prefer implicit aliasing where possible
# L014 = {alias_style: implicit}
# L030 = upper # Enforce uppercase for keywords
# L040 = leading # Place commas at the beginning of lines

# A common starting point is to exclude some rules that might be too strict initially:
# exclude_rules = L003, L013, L030, L040 # Example: allows flexible indentation, trailing commas, mixed casing
